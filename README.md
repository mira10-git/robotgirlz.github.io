# 1. Abstract
This page is a brief of the working behind YOUR 'new hydration buddy' - HYROBOT. The bottle reminds the user to drink water if the water level in the bottle has not reduced every hour. It consists of an LCD which gives information such as water temperature and water level. The LCD has 5 different personality modes which can be switched by pressing the button. Along with the LCD, the bottle also has a speaker which gives the user auditory reminder for drinking water. The 5 different modes are: Happy, Sad, Angry, Sassy and Bored. If the user does not wish to have auditory interuptions, the bottle can be set to mode 5 (bored) which is the 'DO NOT DISTURB' mode. When the water temperature is below 30 °C, a blue LED lights up and when the water temperature is above 30°C, the red LED lights up. 

# 2. Motivation

Everyone is so busy and occupied in their daily lives. Sometimes even the basic things such as drinking water or eating food on time are forgotten or ignored due to the strenuous schedule. For example, the day of a university student in UPenn includes - attending multiple classes + labs, completing back to back deadlines, sometimes working part-time, perhaps working on additional projects in GRASP labs, looking for summer jobs, trying to maintain a social life, taking up extra-curricular activities and so on. The list of things to complete is endless and time constraining. Due to the hustle of life, we forget to drink water -> get dehydrated -> loose energy to complete tasks or survive -> fall sick -> create back logs and this cycle is hopelessly repetitive.  
Here's introducing **Hydrobot**, a bottle that reminds you to hydrate yourself and stay healthy!!!

Don't we all also have a preferred temperature to have our drinks in? Sometimes a little too cold or a little too hot than the normal temperature? For example, most university students fall sick, quite often catching a flu during certain months of the season. When you catch a cold, most of us prefer to drink warm water to ease our throat. Even as the weather gets more chilly in Philly, we start avoiding colder water. While getting hot beverages, how many of us have slightly burnt our tongue? I am sure quite a few of us have.
Here's why we are adding the feature of temperature readings to **Hydrobot**, so that everyone can enjoy their drinks in the temperature they'd like and avoid mishaps such as burning your toungue. Even when you don’t need a reminder **Hydrobot** is a friendly face monitoring the temperature of your water, using infrared technology, so you know the temperature is just right!!!

**Hydrobot** takes you through your own personalised hydration journey:)))

# 3. Goals

* Create an automatic water bottle that would remind us to intake a significant amount of water every hour.
* The bottle gives the temperature read of the beverage inside, so that the consumers can have their preferred beverage in the temperature of their choice (hot/cold).
* A speaker that talks in the voice of your choice and style that reminds you to hydrate yourself.
* An LCD that tries to interact with the user by showing emojis, temperature value and how much water was drank in that day.
* A switch that lets you choose if you would like the speaker or LCD to interact with you or not (so that the bottle does not create any inconvinience in public places)
